Puzzle is a very easy game to play.  Start Puzzle, then migrate to a Folder that contains Image files.  You may select any picture you like.  You may use the same picture over or select a new one each time.  If you like, I will select one of the Graphic files at random.  I will give you a few seconds to study the picture before I scramble it.  Then all you have to do is to click on any two puzzle pieces, and press the 'Enter' key.  When you press 'Enter', the last two puzzle pieces that you clicked will trade places.  Keep swapping pieces until the  Puzzle is solved.  The first puzzle has only four large pieces and should be quite easy, but they get progressively more difficult.  Like any Puzzle, some are easier and some are more difficult than others.

Right click once anywhere on the Puzzle to open the Popup Menu.
